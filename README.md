# GooglePayIntegration

#Requirements: Node, NPM, Angular CLI (All latest stable versions would work)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.18.

# Development server

Run `ng serve --hmr` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Configuration:

Change your CKO public and secret keys in app.component.ts global variables. This would be good to go for testing.
